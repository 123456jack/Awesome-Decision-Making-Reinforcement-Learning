This is a paper list of state-of-the-art research materials related to decision making and motion planning. Wish it could be helpful for both academia and industry. (Still updating)

This paper list is divided into three parts. The first part lists the papers which describe the theories of the algorithms, which are the foundations for the further applications. The remaining two parts give the applications of autonomous driving and mobile robots respectively.
